=========================

Experimenting with Sentiment Analysis in Arabic.

Core of the work was done for my CS senior thesis which is in the repo as well.

Main goal of experiments was to show the importance of paying attention to language specific features like morphology 
when doing sentiment analysis or NLP in general.


Paying attention to the morphological richness of Arabic, the accuracy was increased from 68% to 79%.
